# Solving-the-discrete-LQR-problem-using-Reinforcement-Learning

In this research, an attempt has been made to implement various optimization algorithms, including methods based on reinforcement learning, on a self-driving car system.
One of the drawbacks of such services as HJB is that they are offline. This means that the parameter values of the P matrix and controller gain, the basis of all steps should be calculated first and then applied to the main system. In this part, after mentioning the brief introductions, it has been tried to solve both the offline problem of the previous algorithms and their dependence on the system dynamics (or, in other words, reinforcement learning, environment dynamics) by developing methods. A and B should also be solved.
